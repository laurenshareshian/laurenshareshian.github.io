I'm a former math grad student from Duke that fell into high school teaching and loved it. I've been lucky to get to teach calculus, computer science, and advanced electives (Differential Equations, Linear Algebra, Math Modeling, Number Theory, Analysis) to gifted high school students. Lately, I've had the urge to learn something new myself and gravitated towards data science.

I'm a graduate of the Metis Data Science Intensive in Seattle, WA and the Alchemy Code Lab Bootcamp in Portland, OR.
