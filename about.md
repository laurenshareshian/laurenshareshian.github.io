I'm a former math grad student at Duke that fell into high school teaching and loved it. I've been lucky to get to teach calculus, computer science, and advanced electives (Differential Equations, Linear Algebra, Math Modeling, Number Theory, Analysis) to gifted high school students. Lately, I've had the urge to learn something new myself and gravitated towards data science.

I am currently enrolled in the Metis Data Science Bootcamp and in the UCSD Certificate for Advanced Analytics program.
