Title: Enrolling in a Data Science Bootcamp
---


Although the first week of the bootcamp was fast paced, I was pleasantly surprised to find that I knew more than I thought! This comfort was due to significant studying that I did independently in preparation for the bootcamp. In particular, I used the following resources that I highly recommend:

* I took Python & data science courses through the [UCSD Advanced Analytics program](https://extension.ucsd.edu/courses-and-programs/data-mining-for-advanced-analytics). In particular, the Python course used the free [Python for Everyone](https://www.py4e.com/book.php) curriculum by Charles Severance that I highly recommend. The data science course used Ian Witten’s [Data Mining with WEKA](https://weka.waikato.ac.nz/dataminingwithweka/preview).
 
* I worked through the [ThinkStats](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats/) curriculum that included an introduction to Pandas.

* I worked through [Jake Vanderplas' Data Science Handbook](https://github.com/jakevdp/PythonDataScienceHandbook) Jupyter Notebook modules.

* I listened to Michael Kennedy's [Talk Python To Me Podcasts](https://talkpython.fm/) on the way home from work each day.

For anyone considering a data science bootcamp, I would highly recommend working through these resources first. The more you are familiar with ahead of time, the more you’ll get out of the program.
