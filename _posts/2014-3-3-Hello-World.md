title: First Week of Metis Data Science Bootcamp
---
I was glad to find that I knew more than I thought! The courses I took through UCSD (https://extension.ucsd.edu/courses-and-programs/data-science-courses), working through the ThinkStats curriculum (http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats/), and Michael Kennedy's Talk Python To Me Podcasts (https://talkpython.fm/) really helped.

That being said, I still have a lot more work to do getting comfortable with using Pandas cleverly instead of just making for loops and dictionaries by hand.

Also, I still suck at Git.
