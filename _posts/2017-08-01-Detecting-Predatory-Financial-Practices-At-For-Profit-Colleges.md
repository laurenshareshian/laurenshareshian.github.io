Title: Predicting Fantasy Football Leaders using Regression
---

Our second project at Metis involved using scikit-learn and regression models in order to analyze a data set of our choosing. I chose to analyze fantasy football performance, of course, as I wanted to improve my chances of slaughtering my fantasy opponents this season. Each pre-season, ESPN puts out projected rankings of how each player will perform. In September of 2016, ESPN released the [top 300 player rankings](http://www.espn.com/fantasy/football/story/_/id/16287927/2016-fantasy-football-rankings-top-300). You can view the top 10 projected players according to ESPN and the top 10 actual fantasy leaders for the 2016 season below:
