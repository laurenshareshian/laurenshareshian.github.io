A producer felt Corinne was incapable of giving consent, but the video and interviews with various members of cast and crew led Warner Bros. honchos to conclude ... she knew what she was doing.It's interesting ... when 'BiP' filming resumed, new policies were implemented, such as checking bags for prescription drugs, legal or otherwise.

Then Rob went crazy, and our Kardashian sources say she only returned 3 pieces, keeping a ring and 3 tennis bracelets ... worth around $125k. We're told Chyna tried charging a significant amount on Rob's card for some of the jewelry, but it was flagged and denied by Rob's business manager.We're told the jeweler has contacted Chyna several times, telling her the gift was off the table and asking her to return all of the items, but it's fallen on deaf ears.To add insult to injury, Chyna wore the 3 tennis bracelets to court Monday when she got a restraining order against Rob.Chyna begs to differ.

"Dana White has friends in high places ... and that includes Kendrick Lamar.The UFC honcho booked Kendrick Saturday for his son's 16th birthday party at the Brooklyn Bowl in Vegas. We're told about 300 people were in attendance ... but it really seemed like a straight up concert from the looks of this footage shot inside.Kendrick is one of the hottest artists in the game right now, so getting him to play a show -- let alone a private one -- probably doesn't come easy. Yet, one way or another ... Dana sealed the deal.Somewhere out there, Conor McGregor's hoping he can do the same with Floyd.",mcgregor mayweather fight,-13.526966448216745,9.374082853354937

He may take some photos with you, but we ask you and your guests to be respectful of his time and privacy.""Well, he delivered.",trump,-8.920479531789336,15.995466354925844

"President Trump and James Comey's blood feud is just getting started, because POTUS says he's willing to shoot down the ex-FBI Director's testimony ... under oath.The Prez held a news conference in the Rose Garden and, naturally, got peppered with questions about Comey. He insisted he NEVER demanded a loyalty oath from Comey ... and even further said, ""Who would do that? I hardly know the man.""He also insinuated there very well might be recordings of his and Comey's convos ... and he might be willing to let them go public.",trump,-8.556045207959903,14.255008284271012

She bolted from the court when it happened, but the damage was done. The judge has now banished her to an overflow room set up for public viewing of the proceedings.Court officials tell TMZ ... if her phone rings in that room, she'll be permanently ejected from the courthouse altogether.Gloria, who's repping some Cosby accusers (not Andrea Constand), caught a first-time offender break earlier in the week, but she's playing with fire now.",cosby trial,5.458646969666341,18.769651158208127
"President Trump broke his silence on James Comey's testimony ... declaring victory over his former FBI Director, and dismissing him as a ""leaker.""Fair to say, the Prez was NOT impressed with what he saw and heard during Comey's Senate Intel Committee hearing. Early Friday, Trump said, ""Despite so many false statements and lies, total and complete vindication...and WOW, Comey is a leaker!""POTUS' Twitter fingers were silent during Comey's highly anticipated testimony, making the event kind of a let down. Trump's now revealing his takeaway -- Comey had nothing on him when it comes to Russia ... and Comey admitted leaking info about their meetings.Former FBI Director James Comey admitted that he leaked his memos about @POTUS to the press. pic.twitter.com/eRSKoLASldObviously, there was much more said -- such as Comey testifying he couldn't trust the President wouldn't lie -- something many took as a blow to 45's character.Still, Trump's perspective on the event is clear: I win.",trump,-8.786339818953621,14.86683196291188
"Bill Cosby arrived to the courthouse Friday with comedian Joe Torry by his side, oblivious to the fact he dodged a fatal bullet courtesy of his own lawyers.Cosby's attorneys had filed legal docs asking the judge to allow them to introduce evidence accuser Andrea Constand was gay. He bizarrely wanted to show the jury she deceived him ... suggesting he would not have had sex with her if he knew she was gay.The prosecution claimed it was ""victim shaming"" and also violates Pennsylvania law which prohibits the use of evidence involving an alleged victim's sexual past.The judge denied the defense motion, and unless we're missing something, the admission could have nailed Cosby's coffin shut.Andrea Constand told cops she had a boyfriend when she was 14 and had sexual contact with a man when she was in her late 20's. That said, if she wasn't into guys, the prosecution could have destroyed Cosby's argument she consented to sexual contact with the comedian.",cosby trial,5.417873524008978,18.784862142218604
"Another big star calling ""fake news"" on a major newspaper -- with Dana White saying reports he's not involved in the Mayweather vs. McGregor talks are complete BS.The UFC honcho was at Mastro's in Bev Hills on Thursday when we asked about a Los Angeles Times article that says it's the UFC's ownership group (WME-IMG) and NOT White currently involved in negotiations.""We live in a world right now where you can't believe anything that you read,"" White said in a shot at the L.A. Times ... ""Who else would be running the Mayweather, McGregor deal than me?""When we asked if WME was running point, White told us, ""What does WME know about making big fights?""""Trust me, I'm running the Mayweather, McGregor deal.""",mcgregor mayweather fight,-13.42201941975081,10.260811369053954
"Bill Cosby was met by taunts, and a Helen Reddy classic, as he exited his sexual assault trial.One woman made sure Cosby heard her roar outside the Montgomery County Courthouse in PA ... as she blasted ""I Am Woman"" on speakers. Cosby calmly walked past with comedian Joe Torry on his arm.He never reacted visibly, but there's no doubt ... he had to hear the music and the jeers.Earlier Thursday, Cosby seemed very relaxed as he entered court. He didn't look that way on his way out.",cosby trial,5.375996604153895,18.723122340202373
"John McCain says he has a perfectly good excuse for that bizarre line of questioning during the Comey hearing Thursday ... he watched too much baseball the night before.Twitter has been exploding with people mocking the 80-year-old AZ senator for strangely bringing up the Hillary Clinton investigation while everyone else wanted answers on Russia and Trump.McCain accused Comey of applying a double standard by closing the Clinton investigation while leaving the Trump inquiry open. Comey's explanation was that the Clinton investigation ran its course while the Trump investigation had barely started when Trump fired him.This seemed a rational explanation for everyone in the room, except for McCain who seemed baffled.Now, McCain has issued a statement trying to explain (and also poking fun at himself) ... saying:""I get the sense from Twitter that my line of questioning today went over people's heads. Maybe going forward I shouldn't stay up late watching the Diamondbacks night games.""For the record, the D-Backs played the Padres Wednesday night ... and won 7-4.",trump,-10.485526922647763,14.854358730268554
"Former FBI Director James Comey's highly anticipated testimony had something for everyone -- supporters of President Trump, but also his detractors.Comey told Sen. Richard Burr he had no doubts Russia attempted to interfere, and made cyber attacks on voter files and the DNC -- but he's also confident they were not able to alter a single vote in the 2016 election.The biggest bombshell though was his explanation for why he took detailed notes after every meeting with President Trump. Comey said, ""I was honestly concerned that he might lie about the nature of our meeting and so I thought it really important to document.""He also got into whether the President leaned on him to back off Gen. Mike Flynn or the Russia investigation.The hearing stopped everything in D.C. -- some interns were waiting in line since 3 AM to get into the hearing",trump,-8.844574249879917,14.910847168962858

Graham on the Hill -- just before the Comey hearing began -- and he gave us his pre-game analysis. While the whole nation's got Comey fever, Graham says, ""it's gonna be a lot of theater.""His point is the Prez has nothing to worry about, and this whole hearing is just a lot of posturing.",trump,-9.686147108097265,13.21099166070219
